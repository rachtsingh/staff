# Notes
This is a fork of staff.rs to hard code a path to NotoMusic (included at build time), so we don't have to use font-kit, which doesn't build on the wasm target.

# Staff
[![crate](https://img.shields.io/crates/v/staff.svg)](https://crates.io/crates/staff)
[![documentation](https://docs.rs/staff/badge.svg)](https://docs.rs/staff)
